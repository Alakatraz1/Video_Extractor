# Video_Extractor
This Python script converts input videos into frames, providing you with a flexible tool to extract individual frames for analysis, processing, or any other purpose. It comes in two versions: a Google Colab notebook version for convenient cloud-based usage, and a locally runnable GUI version for easy desktop operation.
